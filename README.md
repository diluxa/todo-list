Project
---

I always wanted to create my own to-do list, because all the others lists out there are so restrictive and, if you want to get full access, you'll need to pay for it. Of course, my project is too far from to be a complete to-do list, but I'm really satisfied with the result. The goal here was think clearly and try to write a code as simple as possible.
